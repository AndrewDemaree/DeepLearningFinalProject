# DeepLearningFinalProject
This repository focuses on a trail map parser that downloads orthoimages, preprocesses them for CNN training and image segmentation, and implements a modified DeepLabV3+ model. It conducts a grid search over specified hyperparameters, validating the best configurations using loss and intersection over union (IoU).
